# Samvera Connect 2018
## Demo. Hyrax for RabbitMQ Integration

This uses the [Hyrax](https://github.com/samvera/hyrax) digital repository framework to demonstrate the usage of
RabbitMQ in synchronizing repository updates with external services.  It was
developed in order to support a presentation delivered during [Samvera Connect 2018](https://connect2018.lib.utah.edu/).

For the presentation which references this code base, please see the [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18djDCg0FCOCp1l4FkdjuxYV-ffQ6NHYNiJOxTN6ILys/).
